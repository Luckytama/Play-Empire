        Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest[1] for two to six
        players. The standard version is played on a board depicting a political map of the
        earth, divided into forty-two territories, which are grouped into six continents.
        Turn rotates among players who control armies of playing pieces with which they attempt
        to capture territories from other players, with results determined by dice rolls.
        Players may form and dissolve alliances during the course of the game. The goal of the
        game is to occupy every territory on the board and in doing so, eliminate the other
        players.[2] The game can be lengthy, requiring several hours to multiple days to finish.
        European versions are structured so that each player has a limited "secret mission"
        objective that shortens the game.

        Risk was invented in 1957 by Albert Lamorisse, a French filmmaker, and went on to become
        one of the most popular board games in history, inspiring other popular games like Axis
        & Allies and Settlers of Catan. The simple rules but complex interactions make it
        appealing to adults as well as children and families. It is still in production by Hasbro
        with numerous editions and variants with popular media themes and different rules
        including PC software versions, video games and mobile apps.
